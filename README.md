# Demo Sentinel Analytics Rules 


This repository contains custom and community-driven **Microsoft Sentinel Analytics Rules** designed to enhance threat detection, investigation, and response across your environment.

## 📌 Overview

Microsoft Sentinel uses Analytics Rules to proactively identify suspicious behavior and potential threats. This repo provides:

- **KQL-based detection rules** tailored for specific data sources (e.g., Azure AD, Defender, Intune, etc.)
- **Scheduled rules** with customizable thresholds and frequency
- **Behavioral and anomaly detections**
- Rules aligned with frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK** and **NIST**

## 🔍 What's Inside

- `ScheduledRules/`: Rules that run on a recurring schedule
- `FusionRules/`: Rules leveraging Microsoft's built-in machine learning
- `NRT/`: Near-real-time rules for high-priority detections
- `Templates/`: JSON rule templates for easy deployment via ARM or API

## 🛠️ Usage

These rules can be imported into Sentinel using:
- Microsoft Sentinel UI
- ARM templates
- Azure Resource Graph Explorer
